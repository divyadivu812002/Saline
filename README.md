Saline monitoring system  is designed to monitor the weight of a saline container in order to ensure that the correct amount of saline is being used. The system utilizes a load cell to measure the weight of the container and its contents, and a microcontroller to read and process the weight data. 
The microcontroller is programmed to compare the weight data to a target weight range and to trigger an alert system if the weight is outside the acceptable range.
The alert system could be an audible alarm where we use buzzer and the alert message will be send  to the nurse/doctor using GSM Module.The system is typically used in medical settings where the precise amount of saline is critical for patient safety and treatment efficacy. The load cell provides accurate and reliable weight measurements, ensuring that the correct amount of saline is always being used.
